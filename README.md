# ZKProof Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof system to demonstrate the knowledge of a solution for the equation \(x^2 + x + 7 = 9\) without revealing the value of \(x\). The project utilizes the **snarkjs** framework and the **Circom** programming language to design and verify ZK circuits.

## Core Concepts
- **Objective**: Prove knowledge of \(x\) such that \(x^2 + x + 7 = 9\) without disclosing \(x\).
- **ZK Protocol Chosen**: Groth16 due to its efficient proof size and fast verification times.

## Installation

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**   
   ```bash
  *** git clone <repository-url>
   cd ZK_Project_VeriSync ***

‚öñÔ∏è Trade-offs in ZK Protocols
Summary of Trade-offs
Aspect	Groth16	Plonk	STARKs
Proof Generation Time	Moderate to long (dependent on setup)	Fast (due to polynomial commitment)	Longer due to hash computations
Proof Size	Small (around 100 bytes)	Small to moderate	Larger (depending on depth of circuit)
Verification Time	Very fast (a few milliseconds)	Fast, but dependent on the implementation	Moderate (but scalable)

üéØ Conclusion
The project successfully showcases the capabilities of zero-knowledge proofs, particularly through the Groth16 protocol. The implementation emphasizes the potential of ZK technology for privacy-preserving computations across various applications.
