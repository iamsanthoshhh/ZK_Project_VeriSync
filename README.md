Assesment for Verisync Lab ZK Research Engineer
# ZKProof Project

## Overview
This project focuses on implementing a zero-knowledge (ZK) proof system to demonstrate the knowledge of a solution for the equation \(x^2 + x + 7 = 9\) without revealing the value of \(x\). The project utilizes the **snarkjs** framework and the **Circom** programming language to design and verify ZK circuits.

## Project Structure
**Equation.circom: Circuit file defining the equation x^2 + x + 7.**

**input.json: JSON file containing the public inputs to be used for proof generation.**

**Equation_js: Folder generated by Circom containing JavaScript files needed to generate the witness.**

**pot_final.ptau: Powers of Tau file required for trusted setup.**

**Equation_0000.zkey: The initial zkey file generated during the trusted setup.**

**Equation_final.zkey: The final zkey file with contributions.**

**public.json: JSON file with public inputs needed for verification.**

**proof.json: JSON file containing the generated proof.**

## Core Concepts
- **Objective**: Prove knowledge of \(x\) such that \(x^2 + x + 7 = 9\) without disclosing \(x\).
- **ZK Protocol Chosen**: Groth16 due to its efficient proof size and fast verification times.

## Installations

### Prerequisites
- **Node.js** (version 16 or higher)
- **npm** (Node Package Manager)

### Steps to Setup

1. **Clone the Repository**   
   ```bash
   git clone <repository-url>
   cd ZK_Project_VeriSync
2. **Install Dependencies**
   ```bash
   npm install
3. **Compile the circuit **
   ```bash
   circom Equation.circom --r1cs --wasm --sym

4. ** Trusted setup **
   ```bash
   snarkjs powersoftau new bn128 12 pot_final.ptau
   snarkjs groth16 setup Equation.r1cs pot_final.ptau Equation_0000.zkey
   snarkjs zkey contribute Equation_0000.zkey Equation_final.zkey --name="First contribution" -v
   snarkjs zkey export verificationkey Equation_final.zkey verification_key.json

5. **Generate the witness **
   ```bash
   node Equation_js/generate_witness.js Equation_js/Equation.wasm input.json witness.wtns

6. ** Generate the proof **
   ```bash
   snarkjs groth16 prove Equation_final.zkey witness.wtns proof.json public.json

7. ** Verify the proof **
   ```bash
   snarkjs groth16 verify verification_key.json public.json proof.json
